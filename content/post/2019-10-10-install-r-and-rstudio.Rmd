## 1. Download R
Download R from this site (I choose the first URL in US, just for convenience, technically they are all the same):
https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu

Download based on your system: Windows/IOS/Linux

Then install.

## 2. Download RStudio
From here:
https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

choose the first one, free.

Then install. 

### Now you are ready to go!
